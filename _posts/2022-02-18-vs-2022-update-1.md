<h1>Compiler and CRT</h1>

VS 2022 Update 1 includes a revision of the C/C++ compiler (19.31.31104.0).

17.1 update | C++ compiler
--|--
17.1.0 | 19.31.31104.0
17.1.2 | 19.31.31105.0
17.1.4 | 19.31.31106.0

The C/C++ Runtime (14.31.31103) is binary compatible with VS 2015 Update 3 through VS 2022, which means you can safely link C/C++ code built with VS 2015 Update 3, VS 2017, or VS 2019 with VS 2022. See [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/binary-compat-2015-2017?view=msvc-170) for details. A full list of updates to the *Standard C++ Library* can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/VS-2022-Changelog#vs-2022-171).
