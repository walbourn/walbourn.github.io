The C/C++ Runtime (14.32.31326) is binary compatible with VS 2015 Update 3 through VS 2022, which means you can safely link C/C++ code built with VS 2015 Update 3, VS 2017, or VS 2019 with VS 2022. See [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/binary-compat-2015-2017?view=msvc-170) for details.
