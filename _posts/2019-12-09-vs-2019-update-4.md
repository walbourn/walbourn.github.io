<h1>Compiler and CRT</h1>

VS 2019 Update 4 includes a new version of the C/C++ compiler (19.24.28314.0).

The C/C++ Runtime (14.24.28127) is included in this update. Remember that VS 2015, VS 2017, and VS 2019 share the same runtime redistributable binaries and are 'binary compatible'.

> Note that the Visual C/C++ Runtime library is now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/STL). See [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/open-sourcing-msvcs-stl/) for more information.

<strong>C++20</strong>: The ``/std:c++latest`` switch enables support for C++20 draft features including [conditionally explicit constructors](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c20s-conditionally-explicit-constructors/).

<strong>C++ Code Analysis</strong>: VS 2019 (16.4) now includes support for clang-tidy for both the Clang and MSVC toolsets. See [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/code-analysis-with-clang-tidy-in-visual-studio/) for details.

<strong>clang/LLVM</strong>: VS 2019 Update 4 includes [clang 9](https://releases.llvm.org/9.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) for Windows as an optional component.

<strong>DirectXMath</strong>: There is a known issue where the <code>IsNan</code> tests can fail when building with <code>/fp:fast</code> due to new optimizations. This is fixed when using [DirectXMath 3.14](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXMath/releases/tag/aug2019) in combination with this update.
