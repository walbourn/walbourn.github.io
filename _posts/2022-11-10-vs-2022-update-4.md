>  Note that VS 2022 17.0, 17.2, and 17.4 are supported through the [Long Term Servicing Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/productinfo/vs-servicing#long-term-servicing-channel-ltsc-support).

<h1>Compiler and CRT</h1>

VS 2022 Update 4 includes a revision of the C/C++ compiler (19.34.31933.0). Note there are a few new warnings at high warning levels (C5262, C5264), as well as additional improvements when working with [large C++ codebases](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/faster-cpp-source-code-indexing/).

17.4 update | C++ compiler
--|--
17.4.0 | 19.34.31933.0
17.4.2 | 19.34.31935.0
17.4.3 | 19.34.31937.0
17.4.5 | 19.34.31942.0

The C/C++ Runtime (14.34.31931) is binary compatible with VS 2015 Update 3 through VS 2022, which means you can safely link C/C++ code built with VS 2015 Update 3, VS 2017, or VS 2019 with VS 2022. See [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/binary-compat-2015-2017?view=msvc-170) for details. A full list of updates to the *Standard C++ Library* can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/Changelog#vs-2022-174).

<strong>clang:</strong> VS 2022 17.4 includes [clang/LLVM v15.0.1](https://releases.llvm.org/15.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) for Windows as an optional component. This version fixes 'unsuppressable warnings' from the linker when using the latest Microsoft platform libraries due to new Control Flow Guard metadata. This impacts some libraries in the [Windows SDK (22621)](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-sdk-for-windows-11,-version-22h2/) and the Microsoft GDK (October 2022 or later) releases.

<strong>CMake:</strong> This update also includes CMake [version 3.24](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.24/release/3.24.html#cmake-3-24-release-notes).

<strong>ARM64</strong> Update 4 is the first fully supported release of Visual Studio for ARM64 native. See [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/arm64-visual-studio-is-officially-here/).
