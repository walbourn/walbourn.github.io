<em>Visual Studio 17.0 - 17.10 are out of their [support lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-2022) as of <b>January 2026</b>.</em>

<h1>Compiler and CRT</h1>

VS 2022 Update 6 includes a revision of the C/C++ compiler (19.36.32532.0).

17.6 update | C++ compiler
--|--
17.6.0 | 19.36.32532.0
17.6.3 | 19.36.23534.0
17.6.4 | 19.36.32535.0
17.6.5 | 19.36.32537.0

The C/C++ Runtime (14.36.32532) is binary compatible with VS 2015 Update 3 through VS 2022, which means you can safely link C/C++ code built with VS 2015 Update 3, VS 2017, or VS 2019 with VS 2022. See [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/porting/binary-compat-2015-2017?view=msvc-170) for details. A full list of updates to the *Standard C++ Library* can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/Changelog#vs-2022-176).

<strong>C++/CLI managed code</strong>: This version of the compiler and STL includes support for using ``/clr`` with C++20.

<strong>CMake:</strong> This update also includes CMake [version 3.26](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.26/release/3.26.html). There is also a new "CMake Debugger" feature.

<strong>HLSL:</strong> VS 2022 Update 6 now includes the [HLSL Tools extension](https://github.com/tgjones/HlslTools) from Tim Jones as an optional component in the *Game Development* workloads.

<strong>vcpkg:</strong> The vcpkg C++ Package Manager is now included with *C++ Development* workloads. This version of vcpkg includes [xbox triplets](https://walbourn.github.io/vcpkg-now-supports-targeting-xbox/) support. See [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/vcpkg-is-now-included-with-visual-studio/) for more details.

<strong>Windows SDK:</strong> The default Windows SDK for the *Game Development in C++* and *Desktop Development in C++* workloads moved to Windows SDK ([22000](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-sdk-for-windows-11/)).
